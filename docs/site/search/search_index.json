They are basically storming the Village each night ! We won't be able to resist them any longer if this keeps up!

Go Great Hero, investigate this problem before it is too late... Plot Explained The Village you live in is under many unusual Zombie attacks. The raiders are way smarter than usual, making them tough opponents. Being close to downfall of the entire town, the Town Hall has made the decision to send the best of the Heroes to investigate the source of those Raids. Basic Mechanics # Hotbar # The first thing you will notice is that the base HUD of default Minecraft is completely different. The things that have changed are: Food Bar is gone, as it is irrelevant to the gameplay. Health Bar is now gone, replaced with a giant Hardcore Heart on your left side of the screen . Armor Bar is gone, its display was moved into the Inventory to the Stat Row . Experience Bar is gone, changed into Mana Bar that refills over time. You have only 1 row of Inventory free to your management, as the Ender Chest is much bigger now. The Hotbar has now a new and unchangable layout: (ordered counting from left to right) 1 st slot is for a Melee Weapon . 2 nd slot s for a Ranged Weapon . 3 rd slot is now reserved for a Potion of your desires. 4 th slot is Arrows (or other projectiles) . 5 th , 6 th and 7 th slot are reserved for Artifacts , Spells and other equipable items . Last 2 slots are special slots for Gadget Star and an equipable gadgets of your choice. Second Hand slot is reserved for Trinkets . All Armor slots are free to use for both cosmetics and actual armor.
