# Base Plot Concept

> "The Zombie attacks have gotten *pretty rough lately...* They are basically storming the Village *each night*! We won't be able to resist them any longer if this keeps up! I have a feeling that **something bad is happening somewhere** across this land..."

> ~ Joe the Town Mayor

> *Who is going to discover the cursed secrets behind this weird phenomenon, if not you? Go Great Hero, investigate this problem before it is too late...*

!!! Info "Plot Explained"
    **The Village you live in is under many unusual Zombie attacks. The raiders are way smarter than usual, making them tough opponents. Being close to downfall of the entire town, the Town Hall has made the decision to send the best of the Heroes to investigate the source of those Raids.**
